## Overview

**HowToBeYoung.com** is a global, women-first longevity mega-site built
to fill the biggest gaps in online health content.

rich-person wellness - Western-only "biohacking" - cosmetic anti-aging -
diet culture - supplement marketing

This project **is**: - science-based - culture-respecting - globally
accessible - measurable - non-toxic and psychologically safe -
mobile-first - free

------------------------------------------------------------------------

## One-Sentence Positioning

**HowToBeYoung.com = the global women's longevity playbook.**\
Science-based. Culture-respecting. Not rich-person wellness. Not diet
culture. Not cosmetic.

------------------------------------------------------------------------

## The 6 Major Gaps This Site Solves

### 1) Women's longevity that isn't fertility-centered

Most women's health content online is dominated by: - pregnancy -
postpartum - periods - "how to lose belly fat" - menopause panic

**What's missing:**\
Women's longevity as its own category, across the full lifespan: **13 →
65+**.

------------------------------------------------------------------------

### 2) Youth preservation that isn't rich-people wellness

Most longevity content assumes you can: - buy supplements monthly - get
frequent blood panels - hire a trainer - have spare time - shop at
premium grocery stores

**What's missing:**\
A real-world system:\
\> "If you have a normal life, here's how you stay young anyway."

------------------------------------------------------------------------

### 3) Non-Western longevity approaches treated with respect

Most wellness content is Western-centered.

When it mentions: - Ayurveda - Traditional Chinese medicine - Andean
herbalism - West African food healing - Indigenous plant medicine

...it is often: - fetishized - oversimplified - treated as a trendy
"hack"

**What's missing:**\
Cultural longevity practices explained with **respect + practicality**.

------------------------------------------------------------------------

### 4) Youth as something measurable (without medical gatekeeping)

Most sites offer either: - vague "feel better" advice\
or\
- advanced diagnostics and lab culture

**What's missing:**\
A simple **Youth Scoreboard** anyone can do, including: - resting heart
rate - sleep quality - strength baseline - mobility tests - inflammation
symptoms - mental sharpness - stress resilience - cycle health (if
applicable)

------------------------------------------------------------------------

### 5) Aging prevention that isn't cosmetic

The internet over-focuses on: - skin - hair - Botox - face symmetry -
collagen

**But youth is actually:** - mitochondrial health - muscle mass -
hormones - stress load - insulin sensitivity - inflammation - gut
health - cardiovascular conditioning

**Core principle:**\
\> Your face is not your youth.\
\> Your systems are.

------------------------------------------------------------------------

### 6) Longevity content that doesn't trigger disordered eating

A lot of "stay young" content is essentially: - diet culture - fear of
fat - shame - restriction obsession

**What's missing:**\
A longevity site that teaches youth and health **without becoming
eating-disorder fuel**.
